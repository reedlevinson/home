# Activity - Intersect 'em !

With your group,

1. Review [set_iterate2](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/examples/blob/main/set_iterate2.c).
(Note also [set_iterate.makefile](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/examples/blob/main/set_iterate.makefile).)
It shows how to construct the *union* of two sets.

2. Discuss how you would construct the *intersection* of two sets - it's analogous, but harder than it looks!
(I found that the `itemfunc` needed a pointer to each set, not just the one set, as in the example above.)

3. [If you have time,] Create a `set_iterate3.c` by modifying [set_iterate2](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/examples/blob/main/set_iterate2.c), and add the intersection functionality.

You'll need this technique for Lab 6!

Put your team's answers in a Markdown file and upload it to Canvas for Activity 19.
