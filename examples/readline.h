/* readline - Safely read a line of stdin into `buf`.
 * 
 * We assume:
 *   Caller provides valid buffer `buf` with room for `len>0` characters.
 * We return
 *   `buf` filled with reading characters from file `fp` until newline or EOF.
 * We guarantee:
 *   we won't over-run the end of the buffer;
 *   null-terminated string in the buffer;
 *   no newline in the buffer.
 * We return:
 *   true if success and false if EOF or any error.
 * Notes:
 *   If the user enters more than len-1 characters, that is considered an error.
 *   If end-of-file is reached before newline, that is considered an error.
 *   If an error occurs, buf may have been written but should be untrusted.
